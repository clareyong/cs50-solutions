sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: It takes the longest time whether sorted or not.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It takes the same and lowest amount of time whether the data is sorted or not.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: It takes a short time if it is already sorted, and a longer time if not.

The shortest time for a sorted file is using bubble sort, second is merge, last is selection
Sorted
sort1: 0.076, 1.91
sort2: 0.059, 2.343
sort3: 0.051, 5.687

Random
sort1: 0.081, 8.325
sort2: 0.051, 2.779
sort3: 0.083, 6.505

Reversed
sort1: 0.077, 11.073
sort2: 0.048, 2.049
sort3: 0.051, 3.880

Among all 3, sort2 takes the shortest time for all datasets whether sorted or not. It is likely to be merge sort
sort3 takes the shortest time when it is all already sorted, it should be bubble sort
sort1 is selection sort
